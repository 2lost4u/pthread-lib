#summary Design Document pthread-lib

This is the design document for pthread-lib. You will find the exact specification of what each piece of code was designed.

== 1 Core Design ==
=== 1.1 Data Structures ===
1.1.1 An expandable array of thread pool pointers (THREAD_POOL). This allows the programmer to create multiple pools of threads
1.1.2 An expandable array of function pointers. This will function as the queue that work will be submitted to. This should be able to be assigned to any pool or every pool. For example, pool A gets function pointers from queue 1 and queue 2 while pool B gets function pointers from queue 2 only. This and any configuration should be possible.
1.1.3 A THREAD_POOL struct that contains a core_pool_size, max_pool_size, keep_alive_time, curr_pool_size, 
1.1.4 A THREAD_POOL_STATE struct that consists of RUNNING=0, SHUTDOWN=1, STOP=2, TERMINATED=3
1.1.5 A THREAD struct that contains various information about a thread.
1.1.5.1 *TODO: what data should be in the THREAD struct?*

=== 1.2 Methods ===
==== public methods ====
1.2.1 submit(function_pointer) - submits the function pointer to be executed
1.2.2 submit(function_pointer, queue)
1.2.3 submit(function_pointer, pool)
1.2.4 awaitTermination(long timeOut)

==== private methods ====
1.2.? addThread - adds a thread to the pool up to max_pool_size if demand is high
1.2.? poll - waits to get a task from the assigned queues (must have alg. for checking multiple queues
1.2.? take - takes the function pointer off the queue and executes it (must have mutex)
