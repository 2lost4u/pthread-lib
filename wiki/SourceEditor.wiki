In order to use this library, you will need to run on a {{{*}}}nix environment. I used Ubuntu Linux to develop it.

The following commands are specific to Ubuntu, but can be easily transferred to any Linux distribution.

=== Install ===
type {{{ sudo apt-get install anjuta }}} in the console OR
you can use your favorite package manager to download it

The following are Anjuta dependencies:

  * blah2

=== Create A Project ===

=== Compile And Link It ===
  # Right-click on the project
  # Choose Properties
  # Enter -lpthread in as a library
  # Go to Build-->Run Autogenerate (this will execute libtool and update it with the library reference)
